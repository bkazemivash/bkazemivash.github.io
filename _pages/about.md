I am a graduate student at the Computer Science department of Georgia State University. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the prestigious Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science ([TReNDS](https://trendscenter.org)), a collaborative research hub involving Georgia Tech, Georgia State, and Emory University. Under the supervision of [Dr. Vince Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My academic journey is centered around the interesting realm of <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, with a specific focus on its application in the intricate field of neuroimaging. Precisely, my intellectual curiosity is drawn to the intricate domains of <strong>dense prediction</strong>, <strong>spatiotemporal dynamics</strong>, and <strong>multi-task training</strong> to make meaningful contributions to both the scientific community and society as a whole.
